## MNFFL

This is a site being built in for a fantasy football league. Users will be able to log in, make posts, view archive. Admins can add to archive files. I will be using Laravel, MySQL, RESTful routing, CRUD functionality for resources, user authentication, SASS, NPM. The front end will be designed using Bootstrap.
